alfred-google-verbatim
======================

Alfred hotkey (command-shift-quote) for triple-quoting selected text with a browser focused. Really quite unnecessary but turned out to be [dead simple](http://support.alfredapp.com/workflows:config:triggers-hotkey) in Alfred, and is handy if you commonly need verbatim keywords in your googlings

wierd speling -> `⌘+⇧+'` -> """wierd speling"""

This workflow is a zip of the `src` directory with the `.alfredworkflow` extension
